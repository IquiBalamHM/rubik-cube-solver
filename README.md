You have to face the robot in the following order for it to be desplayed correctly with matplotlib.

g -> r -> b -> o -> y -> w
F -> R -> B -> L -> U -> D

Match the colors with the faces, i.e. green (g) with Front (F), red(r) with Right (r), blue (b) with Back (B), orange (o) with Left, yellow (y) with Up (U) and white with (Down). If your cube does not have this color order, don't worry, while you present the faces in the order (F,R,B,L,U,D) it will work.
